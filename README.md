# PitchforkVis Pipeline
An (increasingly) automated pipeline for fetching, processing, and publishing data for my [Pitchfork visualization project](https://github.com/rickycurry/PitchforkVis). Currently upon execution of a single shell script, it robustly handles the first two points (fetching and processing), and as time allows I'll sort out the publishing as well. (The visualization is hosted [here](https://rickycurry.github.io/PitchforkVis/vis/index.html) on GitHub Pages, so publishing new data is as easy as committing and pushing.)
